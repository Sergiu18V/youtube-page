Youtube page
Youtube page from Odin project
It took me a while to reach this form, I had most of the trouble with the video and the sidebar. I used flex for both of them, and then I used relative for the sidebar to move it where I wanted to. Another option would have been to use a div to contain both the video and the sidebar, and then to float the video to the left. That might have worked. I am not too happy about the end result, as I feel like I "hammered" through it, by constantly making changes to CSS until I found the proper result. It does not work on mobile, but I did not event attemp to fix it there

I will try to recreate the content with float for video. 

Pros: 
I got to use flex and the positioning
I did not give up

Cons: 
I did not use a smooth solution, but I used trial and error
I did not use all the elements from the page, only some of them, such as all the icons

Overall: 6/10
